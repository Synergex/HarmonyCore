    <h3 id="jeff-greene-harmony-core-product-manager">Jeff Greene, Harmony Core Product Manager</h3>

<p><img src="/HarmonyCore/assets/2019-03-22/image2.png" alt="Jeff Greene" style="float:left; padding:10px;" />Jeff joined Synergex in 2006 and he
brought his passion for open source and standards-based technologies
with him.</p>

<p>His first contribution to our product suite was Synergy DBL Integration
for Visual Studio, for which he architected and implemented items
involving Intellisense, debugging, and migration tools. He championed
the importance of running Synergy on .NET Core and was the lead
developer of that project.</p>

<p>Jeff has been instrumental in Synergex’s embrace of Service Oriented
Architecture (SOA) and standards-based technologies. When the need for a
unified solution to creating web services for all Synergy/DE
applications arose, Jeff and Steve Ives created the Harmony Core
Framework with an emphasis on using standardized technologies such as
OData, Swagger, Asp.NET Core, .NET Core and Entity Framework Core.</p>

<p>Jeff has worked with various departments within Microsoft over the
years, and has made significant contributions to the open source
Microsoft CoreRT project.</p>

<h3 id="steve-ives-harmony-core-co-architect">Steve Ives, Harmony Core Co-Architect</h3>

<p><img src="/HarmonyCore/assets/2019-03-22/image3.png" alt="Steve Ives" style="float:left; padding:10px;" />Following an initial background in
operating systems, networking and systems administration early in his
career, Steve realized that his real passion and talent was in the field
of software development.</p>

<p>Having worked for one of the largest Synergy/DE developers in the United
Kingdom, Synergex frequently contracted Steve to present on Synergex
locally in Europe. These engagements consisted of presenting on the
company and products during meetings, delivering training seminars on
the use of the products, and consulting with other customers about how
to address specific technology requirements.</p>

<p>Steve formally joined the Synergex Professional Services group in 1997.
Having held the position of Senior Consultant for over 20 years, Steve
has assisted many Synergy developers to architect, design and implement
a wide variety of software projects. Each of these projects involves
Synergy/DE in some way, and many involve a wide range of other
development languages and technologies.</p>

<p>In recent years, Steve has been a major contributor to several
Synergy-related open source development projects, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The CodeGen code generator which can be used to automate the
generation of Synergy DBL and other types of code in a wide variety
of software scenarios</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The SQL Replication reference implementation—this provides a
working example and most of the code needed to replicate a Synergy
application’s ISAM and Relative data to a SQL Server database, in
near-real-time</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A PDF API that allows Synergy developers to easily add PDF file
creation to their applications</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Harmony Core framework which provides Synergy developers the
ability to quickly and easily build RESTful Web Service APIs to
expose their Synergy data and business logic to a wide variety of
applications and environments</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Steve is passionate about assisting software developers to continue to
leverage the investment that they have made in their Synergy code base
over the years, and to continue to see a return on their ongoing
investments in their code.</p>

<h3 id="johnson-luong-harmony-core-developer">Johnson Luong, Harmony Core developer</h3>

<p><img src="/HarmonyCore/assets/2019-03-22/image4.png" alt="Johnson Luong" style="float:left; padding:10px;" />Johnson joined Synergex in 2014 as a QA
engineer. He got his start by testing Synergy releases and the Synergex
Resource Center Community, as well as verifying trackers and automating
the testing of those trackers. You can read about his 
<a href="https://www.synergex.com/installation-authoring-and-testing-techniques/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">testing techniques</a>
and <a href="https://www.synergex.com/testing-testing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">automated testing</a> at Synergex.</p>

<p>In addition, after moving into a software development role, Johnson made
many contributions to our Synergy DBL Integration for Visual Studio
(SDI) product including migrating from WinForms to the WPF property
pages and the product installers from InstallShield to a newer
technology. He has since developed all of our Synergy product installers
with the open-source language, WiX. He worked closely with Fire Giant,
the custodian of WiX, to ensure the Synergy installers are using their
most up-to-date technology.</p>

<p>Prior to joining Synergex, Johnson was an active member of the
Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) at his alma mater. Along with his team, he even won
their biannual International Collegiate Programming Contest. His
background in test along with experience in Visual Studio development
and solid foundational knowledge of algorithm design make Johnson the
perfect addition to round out the Harmony Core team.</p>
